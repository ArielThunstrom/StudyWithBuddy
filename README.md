# Study With Buddy
Recently, studies have shown that teens get distracted by phones every 15 minutes, and once they are distracted it takes an average of 23 minutes for them to get back on track. This causes the students to lack focus, and makes it difficult to for them to succeed in classes. 
As upperclassmen in high school, we are constantly studying for tests and working on projects. Our homework requires our full attention, but it can be hard to focus when your phone is just sitting there, waiting for you to open TikTik or Instagram. But what if you phone could actually help you focus? Our app study buddy solves this problem.
